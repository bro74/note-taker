# note-taker

## Description
This is a note maker to generate, save and delete notes similar to a to-do list built using a starter code. This app will generate a space for note taking using EXPRESS.js for the back end development. The user is a small business owner who wants to to be able to write and save notes, so they can organize their thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete To use this logo-generator installed node.js and express.js. Be sure to open http://localhost:3001 to view the app. This challenge seemed to completely switch my thoughts on programming. Back end developmental is very challenging and I definitely prefer CSS or frontend development. I could not get my logic to sync to actually create a saved note. I also am locked out of my heroku account for deployment. I have decided to move on from this challenge, respectuflly.
